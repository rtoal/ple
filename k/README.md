# K Explorations

To run K programs locally, install [Kona](https://github.com/kevinlawler/kona) or [oK](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/ok). If using Kona, stdin is generally read, so to run a script without input, use a command such as:

```
k triple.k < /dev/null
```

To run the tests, invoke `./test.sh` in a Unix-friendly shell.

## About

K is an array processing programming language derived from APL and developed by Arthur Whitney in 1993. The kdb+ database and several high-speed financial products use K.
