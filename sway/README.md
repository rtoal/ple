# Sway Explorations

To build and run Sway programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent version from the [Sway installation page](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/v0.19.0/introduction/installation.html) or use your favorite package manager.

Programs in this folder have yet to be tested.
<!-- and can be run from the command line like so: -->

<!-- ```
ruby triple.rb
```

```
ruby permutations.rb I like carrots
```

```
ruby top_ten_scorers.rb < ../test/wnba_input
```

Running the command `irb` with no arguments gives you a repl.

To run the tests, invoke `./test.sh` in a Unix-friendly shell or `test.ps1` in PowerShell. -->
