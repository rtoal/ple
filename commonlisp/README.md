# Lisp Explorations:

To start coding with Lisp, you’ll need to set up an environment that can run Lisp dialects like Common Lisp or Scheme. A popular choice is [SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp)](http://www.sbcl.org/) or [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) which supports multiple Lisp-like languages.

You can also explore Lisp syntax, macros, and standard libraries on the [Common Lisp Hyperspec](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/) or through Scheme’s extensive online documentation.

Once you have a Lisp environment installed, you can evaluate Lisp scripts directly in a REPL or run full Lisp programs from your terminal/development environment.

## About Lisp:

Lisp was first developed in the late 1950s by John McCarthy and remains one of the oldest programming languages still in active use. The language is known for its fully parenthesized prefix notation and powerful macro system which largely influenced modern programming languages. Its emphasis on symbolic manipulation, list processing, and functional programming paradigms makes Lisp a favorite among enthusiasts, researchers, and AI developers. Many dialects of the language have emerged, with Common Lisp and Scheme (see [Scheme](https://github.com/rtoal/ple/tree/main/scheme)) being two of the most popular today.

## Lisp Resources:

Continue your study of Lisp via:

- [Common Lisp Hyperspec](https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm)
- [Practical Common Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/)
- [Scheme Racket Guide](https://docs.racket-lang.org/)
- [Common Lisp Cookbook](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/)

## Lisp Open Source Projects:

Studying, and contributing to, open source projects is an excellent way to improve your proficiency in any language. Grain is an open-sourced project so that would be an excellent place to start:

- [SBCL GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sbcl/sbcl/issues)
- [Quicklisp Libraries](https://quicklisp.org/)
- [Racket GitHub Issues](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues)
