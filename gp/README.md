# GP Explorations

Because GP is a visual programming language, all of the code you will be writing (or building since they are blocks) will be on [GP Online Sandbox](https://gpblocks.org/run/gp.html).

Since GP cannot be written in an IDE nor can be run on the command line, you can only open one of the sb3 files in the examples via opening save files. In the editor, click on "Upload" to open your code. After loading the file, you can hit "Go" to run the program. Unlike a command line, the output will be in a form of a speech bubble for some examples.
