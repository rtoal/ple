# Vyxal Explorations

To run Vyxal programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent language version from the [Vyxal GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Vyxal/Vyxal/releases) or use your favorite package manager. Add the .jar file into this Vyxal folder.

In addition, you will need to download the latest version of Java, so if you have not installed Java, visit to the [PLE's Java README page](https://github.com/rtoal/ple/tree/main/java).

Programs in this folder have been tested using Vyxal 3.7.0 and can be run from the command line like so:

```
java -jar vyxal.jar --file triple.vy
```

```
java -jar vyxal.jar --file permutations.vy I like carrots
```

```
java -jar vyxal.jar --file top_ten_scorers.vy < ../test/wnba_input
```

Running the command `java -jar vyxal.jar` with no arguments gives you a repl.

To run the tests, invoke `.\test.sh` in a Unix-friendly shell or `test.ps1` in PowerShell.

Alternatively, you can use the existing online interpreters:

## About

Vyxal (pronounced Vike-sal) is a stack-based golf language developed by Lyxal in 2020 that is aimed to be terse, readable, convenient, and elegant. Each character has one or multiple commands based on their input types, which include Numbers, Strings, Lists, and Generators, or a command that affects the stack. The language also supports lambda functions that can be ran immediately or stored in a variable.
