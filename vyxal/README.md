# Vyxal Explorations

To run Vyxal programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent language version from the [Vyxal GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Vyxal/Vyxal/releases) or use your favorite package manager.

TODO 
<!-- Programs in this folder have been tested using Python 3.13.2 and can be run from the command line like so:

```
python3 triple.py
```

```
python3 permutations.py I like carrots
```

```
python3 top_ten_scorers.py < ../test/wnba_input
```

Running the command `python3` with no arguments gives you a repl.

If you, as you may have already, are using virtual environments or have aliased `python3` to `python`, you may replace `python3` with `python` in the above commands.

To run the tests, invoke `./test.sh` in a Unix-friendly shell or `test.ps1` in PowerShell. -->
