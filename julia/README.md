# Julia Explorations

To build and run Julia programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent language version from the [Julia downloads page](https://julialang.org/downloads/) or use your favorite package manager.

Programs in this folder have been tested using Julia 1.10.4 and can be run from the command line like so:

```
julia triple.jl
```

```
julia permutations.jl I like carrots
```

```
julia top_ten_scorers.jl < ../test/wnba_input
```

Running the command `julia` with no arguments gives you a repl.

To run the tests, invoke `./test.sh` in a Unix-friendly shell or `test.ps1` in PowerShell.

## About

Julia is a high-level, dynamic programming language designed for scientific and numerical computing, where it competes with Fortran, MATLAB, and Python. As a gradually typed language, it features the ease-of-use of interpreted languages, while exhibiting performance close to that of traditionally compiled languages. It provides object-orientation via multimethods, and has a powerful macro system. The language was created by Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah, and Alan Edelman, and first released in 2012.
