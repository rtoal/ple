# PureScript Explorations

To build and run PureScript programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent language version from the [PureScript home page](https://www.purescript.org/) or use your favorite package manager.

Programs in this folder have been tested using spago 0.21.0 and can be run from the command line like so:

```
spago run -m Triple
```

```
spago run -m Permutations I like carrots            # Have not been tested
```

```
spago run -m TopTenScorers < ..\test\wnba_input             # Have not been tested
```

To run the tests on a Unix-like shell:

```
./test.sh
```

Run `test.ps1` in PowerShell.
