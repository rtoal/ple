# Piet Explorations

Because Piet is a visual programming language, use the following [online editor](https://piet-editor.github.io/) to code in Piet. To save your work, be sure to export the work after you are done, as your changes are not saved locally. This online editor allows you to upload programs by uploading the png files in the example onto the editor (note that the codet pixel size is 20, not 10). Afterwards, you are free to run the program (you may need to reset after uploading as the editor is a bit buggy).

Alternatively, though not recommended, you can still code in Piet by going to [TIO compiler](https://tio.run/#piet) to run Piet in text format.

## About Piet

Piet is a colorful, 2-dimensional, stack-based esoteric programming language developed by David Morgan-Mar around 1990. Etymologically, Piet comes from a well-known Dutch abstract artist Piet Mondrian from the 1917.

Divided into a square grid, there are 20 total cells or codels each with different color. 18 of which are on a rainbow gradient. While the colors themselves do not have any behavior other than white or black, computation is performed based on the changes of shade and gradient from one color to the next color.
