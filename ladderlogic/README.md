# Ladder Logic Explorations

Because Ladder Logic is a visual programming language, all of the code you will be writing (or building since they are blocks) will be on a specific software. Though Ladder Logic is a popular language, we'll be using the [PLC Simulator Online](https://app.plcsimulator.online/) to create our programs.

## About

Ladder Logic is a widely used visual language to program for Programmable Logic Controller or PLCs. Represented by a circuit diagram of relay logic that is executed by real time input.
