# Nemerle Explorations

To build and run Nemerle programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent language version from the [Nemerle home page](http://www.nemerle.org/About#ID0EZD). Make sure that you add your path of the compiler to your environment variables settings if needed.

Programs in this folder can be run from the command line like so:

```
ncc triple.n && out
```

```
ncc permutations.n -- rats && out       # HAS NOT BEEN TESTED
```

```
ncc top_ten_scorers.n < ../test/wnba_input && out       # HAS NOT BEEN TESTED
```

To run the tests on a Unix-like shell:

```
./test.sh
```

Run `test.ps1` in PowerShell.
