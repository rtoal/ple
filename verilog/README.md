# Verilog Explorations

To build and run Verilog programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent language version from the [Icarus compiler downloads page](https://bleyer.org/icarus/) or use your favorite package manager.

Programs in this folder have been tested using Icarus Verilog version 12.0 and can be run from the command line like so:

```
iverilog triple.sv
```

```
iverilog permutations.sv I like carrots         # NOT TESTED YET
```

```
iverilog top_ten_scorers.sv < ../test/wnba_input            # NOT TESTED YET
```

To run the tests, invoke `./test.sh` in a Unix-friendly shell or `test.ps1` in PowerShell.
