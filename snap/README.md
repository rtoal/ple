# Snap! Explorations

Because Snap! is a visual programming language, all of the code you will be writing (or building since they are blocks) will be on [Snap! Online Sandbox](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html).

Since Snap! cannot be written in an IDE nor can be run on the command line, you can only open one of the xml files in the examples via opening save files. In the editor, click on the file icon, then "Open..." to open your code. After loading the file, you can hit the green flag to run the program. Unlike a command line, the output will be in a form of a speech bubble for some examples.
