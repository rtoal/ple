# PHP Explorations

To build and run PHP programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent language version from the [PHP downloads page](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) or use your favorite package manager.

Programs in this folder can be run from the command line like so:

```
php triple.php
```

```
php permutations.php I like carrots           # NOT TESTED YET
```

```
php top_ten_scorers.php < ../test/wnba_input           # NOT TESTED YET
```

Running the command `php -a` with no arguments gives you a repl.

To run the tests on a Unix-like shell:

```
./test.sh
```

Run `test.ps1` in PowerShell.
