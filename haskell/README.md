# Haskell Explorations

To build and run Haskell programs on your local machine, follow the instructions form the [Haskell downloads page](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/). Alternatively (and preferably), fetch and run GHCup.

Programs in this folder have been tested using The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 9.10.1, and can be run from the command line like so:

```
runhaskell triple.hs
```

```
runhaskell permutations.hs I like carrots
```

```
runhaskell top_ten_scorers.hs < ../test/wnba_input
```

Running the command `ghci` with no arguments gives you a repl.

To run the tests, invoke `./test.sh` in a Unix-friendly shell.

## About

Haskell is a general-purpose, statically typed, purely functional programming language with type inference and lazy evaluation. It was created by a number of researchers the late 1980s and first released in 1990. The language is named after the logician Haskell Curry. It is perhaps the most popular of the “pure“ functional languages, and is used in industry for a variety of purposes, including web development, data analysis, and machine learning.
