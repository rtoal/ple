# Solidity Explorations

To build and run Solidity programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent language version from the [Solidity release page](https://www.soliditylang.org/blog/category/releases/) or use your favorite package manager.

No Solidity programs have been tested in this folder. Feel free to contribute by adding a Solidity program in this folder and editing this README on the command used to run the program.

<!-- Programs in this folder have been tested using Python 3.13.2 and can be run from the command line like so:

```
python3 triple.py
```

```
python3 permutations.py I like carrots
```

```
python3 top_ten_scorers.py < ../test/wnba_input
```

Running the command `python3` with no arguments gives you a repl.

If you, as you may have already, are using virtual environments or have aliased `python3` to `python`, you may replace `python3` with `python` in the above commands.

To run the tests, invoke `./test.sh` in a Unix-friendly shell or `test.ps1` in PowerShell. -->

## About

Solidity is a statically-typed specialized blockchain programming language made for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Allowing developers to create contracts, it is used to create Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), develop virtual world economies, creating Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications, all ran through the Etherum token.
