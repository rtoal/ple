# Uiua Explorations

To build and run Uiua programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent language version from the [Uiua downloads page](https://www.uiua.org/install) or use your favorite package manager.

Programs in this folder have been tested using Uiua 0.18.0-dev.1 and can be run from the command line like so:

```
uiua triple.ua
```

```
uiua permutations.ua I like carrots     # NOT TESTED
```

```
uiua top_ten_scorers.ua < ../test/wnba_input       # NOT TESTED
```

Running the command `uiua repl` with no arguments gives you a repl.

To run the tests, invoke `./test.sh` in a Unix-friendly shell or `test.ps1` in PowerShell.
