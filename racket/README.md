# Racket Explorations

To build and run Racket programs on your local machine, download and install the most recent language version from the [Racket home page](https://racket-lang.org/) or use your favorite package manager.

Programs in this folder have been tested using Racket v8.16 and can be run from the command line like so:

```
racket -f triple.rkt
```

```
racket permutations.rkt I like carrots
```

```
racket top_ten_scorers.rkt < ../test/wnba_input     # HAVE NOT TESTED YET
```

Running the command `racket` with no arguments gives you a repl.

To run the tests on a Unix-like shell:

```
./test.sh
```

Run `test.ps1` in PowerShell.
