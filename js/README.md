# JavaScript Explorations

JavaScript is already installed in every modern web browser. To develop command line scripts and servers, download and install Node.js from the [Node home page](https://nodejs.org) or use your favorite package manager.

Programs in this folder have been tested using Node 23.7.0 and can be run from the command line like so:

```
node triple.js
```

```
node permutations.js I like carrots
```

```
node top_ten_scorers.js < ../test/wnba_input
```

Running the command `node` with no arguments gives you a repl.

To run the tests, invoke `./test.sh` in a Unix-friendly shell or `test.ps1` in PowerShell.

Note that this folder contains the file **package.json** to enable each of the command line **.js** files to run as _module_ scripts, rather than _classic_ scripts. Modules are the preferred way to write JavaScript, as they enable a host of newer modern features and are much more safe and secure. For the differences between scripts and modules, see [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) from MDN’s JavaScript Guide.

## About

JavaScript is a modern, expressive, dynamic, event-driven programming language that powers both web and mobile applications. The first version of JavaScript was famously created in 10 days in May of 1995 by Brendan Eich, then at Netscape. It was originally called Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript (borrowing part of its name from a competing language that also debuted the same year). While its infancy was spent as a small, novice-friendly scripting language, today’s JavaScript is a powerful, sophisticated, complex language used on a wide variety of computing platforms servicing both individuals interacting with web browsers and large-scale enterprise applications.
